            <p>
                In the healthcare industry, accuracy and reliability are critical —  whether you're conducting laboratory tests, monitoring water used in  medical processes, or ensuring environmental safety in healthcare  facilities. Precise measurement of parameters like pH, conductivity,  temperature, and water quality plays a vital role in maintaining high  standards of hygiene, safety, and research integrity.</p><p>
                At Rad Sensor, we supply advanced EC (Electrical Conductivity), CTD (Conductivity, Temperature, Depth), pH, and Colorine sensors specifically designed to meet the exacting needs of healthcare, medical laboratories, and environmental health monitoring.<br />

            <h3>Why Accurate Water and Solution Monitoring Matters in
                Health Sectors?</h3>
            <p>

                Contaminated water or improper solution parameters can compromise  patient safety, affect laboratory results, or lead to environmental  health issues. Reliable sensors help healthcare providers and  researchers control water quality, verify solution compositions, and  uphold strict hygiene standards.<br />
            </p>
            <h3>How Our Sensors Support the Healthcare Industry</h3>
